                <h2>About Dogtown Records</h2>
                <p>When we created this record store there was one thing we had in mind, and that was to stay true to our 
                    Californian roots. All workers and owners hail from California whether it be Northern, Southern and 
                    even Central. One important aspect was that we each had a love for either skateboarding or surfboarding, 
                    some could be both, one, or none but still held a love for both sports. Chosing what to call our store and 
                    finding an aestheic was the least difficult part. Lords Of Dogtown is a movie based on real skaters who 
                    were also surfers and thous gave us our store Dogtown. The vision for our store was simple. Create a 
                    place for those who loved the lifestyle of surf and skate as much as we do. Deciding to become a record 
                    store was an idea we all thought about but could never quite see us going through with. In the end we took a chance and that chance eventually paid off. Our record store is inspired by the wierdos, misfits, 
                    and all inbetween. Dogtown is a one of a kind type of record store only to be seen here in sunny 
                    California. Our misson for this record store is to give back to the people who helped make our dreams become a reality.</p>
